# sinfulCat Framework
This project serves as the hub for my Senior Capstone project. As a part of earning my degree in Computer Science at Linfield College, I'm required to submit a final project. My proposal is to gather tools and design a framework that emulates professional modern workflow. The framework will support quick testing, development, and learning of basic HTML/CSS, as well as modularization and common idealogies and practices in FED (Front End Development).  

<strong>tl;dr:</strong> This project contains (or will contain) all the documentation and framework to support a new strain of curriculum for Linfield's Computer Science Department. 

#Demo Explaination

This is a demo version of the sinfulCat framework. The full version will be completed before the end of Fall 2016. This version is designed to help demo the project for COMP 121.

#Finding your way around

Using the framework is easy. Building your webpage from this framework is as simple as working from the 'website' directory. There is already a small example set up for student use.

The demo_modules have the markdown for all of the lessons (which are most easily read <a href="https://github.com/CSKingMartin/sinfulCat/tree/demo/demo_modules/lessons">here</a>), as well as example directories with larger portions of the whole framework in action.

The .gitignore, package.json, and node_modules files/folders should not be altered. This will compromise the functionality of the framework.
