				<h2>SinfulCat is the Capstone Project for Conner Wells</h2>

				<p>This website serves as the hub for my Senior Capstone project. As a part of earning my degree in Computer Science at Linfield College, I'm required to submit a final project. My proposal is to gather tools and design a framework that emulates professional modern workflow. The framework will support quick testing, development, and learning of basic HTML/CSS, as well as modularization and common idealogies and practices in FED (Front End Development).</p>

				<p><strong>tl;dr: This project contains (or will contain) all the documentation and framework to support a new strain of curriculum for Linfield's Computer Science Department.</strong></p>

				<h2>Why develop a Framework and Tutorials?</h2>

				<p>In the spring of 2016, I took an upper-division course at Linfield College on Web Development. Shortly thereafter I had the opportunity to participate in an internship with the Front End Development team at Connective DX the following summer. During my time at Connective DX, I was able to have a hands-on experience with the technology and practices that are used at the professional level. This experience contrasting with the class was noticably different. The world of Web Development is constantly changing, and tools are being swapped out extremely quickly. I decided that I wanted to provide an opportunity for other students at Linfield to be able to get some experience with these tools that have helped me in my career so much already.</p>

				<h2>Project Goals</h2>

				<p>The goals of this project were to help not only teach foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (a Holy Trinity of Sorts), but to also develop skills in the following:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>researching, choosing, and implementing new technologies for personal and large projects;</li>
						<li>standard layout/code organization practices such as SMACSS, Object Oriented CSS, and modularization;</li>
						<li>encourage the development of personal solutions/content in lieu of piggybacking on frameworks such as Flexbox, Bootstrap, and other 3rd party collections.</li>
						<li>moderate Javascript literacy and familiarity with modern development tools such as Node.js, Gulp, and templating languages.</li>

					</ul>

				<p>Like many projects, not all of these goals were met through what I have created. Designing a framework which would meet certain logistical goals was extremely challenging. I found myself working more on iterative versions of gulpfiles and sample projects, and slaving over how to swap these different pieces out at different points in the project. I wanted the learning process to be modular -- that is that at no point in the class would a tool not be fully explained, useful, and relevant. My own journey diving into Gulp and using the different plugins was overwhelming at times, and I wanted to make sure that the submersion into the build system was comfortable and well explained.</p>
				

				<p>One of the key things I didn't care for about COMP405 was the fact that we as inexperienced students did not have a single clue as to why we were being told to use these new tools. Additionally the small scale of our projects did not warrant using the tools we were given. The end project also ratcheted up the difficulty too quickly. The final was purely based on the ability to fumble thorugh a tutorial, and wrestle with deployment we did not understand.</p>

				<p>My curriculum should create a need for each tool, so that the student appreciates and values what they are learning; encourage mastery of each piece of education; develop strong research and problem solving skills so that students feel confident using new tools; and give experience in developing personal solutions instead of finding solutions buried as a part of a larger framework.</p>

				<h2>The Future</h2>

				<p>I think that to reach it's full potential, I would need to continue to pour love and work into this framework to reach all of the goals I've set forth. As it stands right now, my framework does cover how to use the tools in an iterative fashion. I think that it gives ample opportunity and give enough examples that someone approaching this with some HTML and CSS experience can have a decent grasp of gulp, templating, and modularization. I hope to keep adding to the library of lessons and make this something truly standout and resume worthy.</p>
