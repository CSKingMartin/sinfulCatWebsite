							<p>The tools chosen for SinfulCat were carefully selected so that everything is out in the open. Learning with other high-end build-tools like Ruby on Rails have too much of the process hidden in the code. With SinfulCat, the key parts of the framework are given to you piece by piece so you know exactly what's going on all the time.</p>

							<p>The Web Development industry has an extremely high turnover rate with development tools. If the tools are changing all the time, how is someone outside of the industry supposed to keep up? The practices employed in SinfulCat are focused on overarching skills with HTML and CSS that will help you anywhere that are independent on the tools you use.</p>
